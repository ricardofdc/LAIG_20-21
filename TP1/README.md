## Project information

- Cylinder texture:
  - We implemented amplification factors to the texture of the cylinder: for unitary texture coordinatres `afs = perimeter of the biggest base` and `aft = height` of the cylinder.

- Main scene:
  - Our scene represents an island composed by a big ocean, a circular sand island, a wooden hut with a porch, some trees and a couple boats. Inside the hut there are four chairs and a table.
  - Island scene: [LAIG_TP1_XML_T5_G03_island.xml](TP1/scenes/LAIG_TP1_XML_T5_G03_island.xml).
  - More photos of this scene available at [island_photos](TP1/island_photos).
